- **Live URL Querying**: Select any URL from the dropdown to instantly see all keywords it's ranking for
- **Brand/Non-Brand Filtering**: Toggle between "Branded," "Non-Branded," or view all keywords
- **Performance Analysis**: View position, previous position, search volume, and traffic metrics for each keyword
- **Quick Assessment**: Easily identify which terms are driving branded vs. non-branded traffic to better understand organic value

This feature is particularly useful for:
1. Evaluating the true organic value of a page (by filtering to non-branded terms)
2. Identifying opportunities to optimize for specific keywords
3. Determining which pages have the strongest position for competitive terms
4. Assessing whether a page's traffic relies primarily on brand recognition or topical authority

## How to Use This Data

1. **Quick Assessment**: The "Keep?" column provides an immediate recommendation based on traffic value.
2. **Traffic Analysis**: Focus on URLs with highest Traffic (%) for priority optimization.
3. **Keyword Opportunities**: Look for high-volume keywords where current position is on page 2 (positions 11-20) for quick wins.
4. **Content Decisions**:
   - For "Y" URLs: Optimize and expand content
   - For "N" URLs: Either 301 redirect to relevant content or allow to 404
5. **Topic Clustering**: Identify keyword patterns to develop comprehensive content strategies
6. **Brand vs. Non-Brand Analysis**: Use the query tab to understand what percentage of traffic comes from branded terms

## Key Insights

- The LTIP page (https://blog.curocomp.com/long-term-incentive-plans) is the most valuable asset, driving ~75% of traffic
- Several job offer letter pages could be consolidated for better performance
- The David Goggins content drives significant traffic but has questionable business relevance
- The controller job description page has high opportunity value (5,400 monthly searches) but currently ranks on page 2-3

## Next Steps

Use these insights to develop a comprehensive content strategy that:
1. Preserves and strengthens high-performing content
2. Consolidates redundant pages
3. Creates targeted new content for high-opportunity keywords
4. Implements a disciplined technical SEO approach for pages with low value
5. Leverages the query tab to continually assess performance and identify new opportunities
